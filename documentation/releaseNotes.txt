How to install:
	Unzip the file into c:\mjtiming
	This zip file will not modify your existing configuration and data files
	If this is a new installation, config folders, etc. will be created the first time
	you run mjtiming.

Things to do (bugs, deficiencies, wish list)
	Estimate finish time vs number of runs
	Show average overlap (car starting before previous car finishes)(3+ cars)
	Show time for run group changeovers
	In scoring summary, give RAW and PAX ftd
	Remember columns positions and widths when changing tabs
	Bug: OPAX group (1st 3 runs) applies everywhere, not just OPAX group scores
	Scoring -- show DNFs for rookies and non-rookies

	First available car # seed value is now configurable
	Secondary display port now works
	Class sort order now allows floats (e.g. 1.5 will sort between 1 and 2)
	Karelo import now imports columns where the header name matches one in the registration CSV file.
	This does not apply to some special columns (Number, Member, Rookie, First Name, Last Name)
		e.g. 	Use Excel to add a column in your registration file with the heading "Preferred car number"
			Now, if the Karelo report contains a "Preferred car number" column, it will be imported.
			BTW, this is my solution to importing car numbers.  Every club has different rules
			regarding what numbers are open, so I just assign a number above 300.  However, the
			"Preferred car number" column shows what the user wants.
